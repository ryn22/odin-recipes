		<p>Arroz caldo is known by other names, too, including lugaw, pospas and goto, each with slightly different ingredients. The arroz caldo my mother ate was scattered with safflower; like many versions, this one is topped with crisp garlic chips for crunch. A mix of regular and sticky rice gives this dish just the right thickness and texture.</p>
		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
				<li>1 onion, diced</li>
				<li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
				<li>1 (2 inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled and thinly sliced</li>
				<li>2 ¼ pounds chicken wings, split and tips discarded</li>
				<li>1 tablespoon fish sauce (Optional)</li>
				<li>5 ¼ cups chicken broth</li>
				<li>1 cup glutinous sweet rice</li>
				<li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
				<li>1 green onion, chopped</li>
				<li>1 lemon, sliced (Optional)</li>
				<li>1 teaspoon fish sauce for sprinkling, if desired (Optional)</li>
			</ul>
		<h2>Directions</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat. Cook and stir onion, garlic, and ginger in hot oil until fragrant, about 5 minutes. Add chicken wings; cook and stir for 1 minute. Stir in fish sauce, cover, and cook another 2 minutes.</li><br>
				<li>Pour chicken broth into the pot. Stir in sweet rice and bring mixture to a boil. Cover and cook for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent rice from sticking to the bottom of the pot. Season with salt and pepper.</li><br>
				<li>Portion soup into bowls and garnish with green onion. Serve with lemon slices and additional fish sauce, if desired.</li>
			</ol>
